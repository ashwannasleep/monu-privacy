## 🔐 Privacy Policy

> **Your privacy is our priority.**  
> MONU is designed to keep your personal planning data secure and private.

### 📦 Data Collection & Storage

MONU operates with a privacy-first approach:

- **Authentication:** We use AWS Cognito for secure user authentication. Your email and basic profile information are stored securely.
- **Local Storage:** Most of your planning data (tasks, habits, goals) is stored locally on your device using `UserDefaults`.
- **Cloud Sync:** If you choose to sync, your data is stored securely in AWS Amplify with end-to-end encryption.
- **Calendar Integration:** When you connect Google Calendar, we only access the calendar data you explicitly authorize. We do not store your Google credentials.

### 🚫 What We Don't Do

- We never sell your personal data to third parties  
- We don't track your usage patterns or behavior  
- We don't share your planning data with advertisers  
- We don't access your device's camera, microphone, or location  

### ⚙️ Data Control

You have complete control over your data:

- Delete your account and all associated data at any time  
- Export your planning data in standard formats  
- Disconnect calendar integrations with one tap  
- Request data deletion by emailing [contactmonuplanner@gmail.com](mailto:contactmonuplanner@gmail.com)
